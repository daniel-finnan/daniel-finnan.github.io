# To Do

- Styling
    - add customisation

Renamed `assets` and `_sass` folder to `..._OLD` temporarily to store old styling.

Trying to drop in new CSS from Minima 2.5.2 theme.
Changed link to css file in `head.html`
Altered `header` to apply correct styling, notably using `nav-items` and `nav-item` from 2.5.2 version, pulled out from `nav-items`.
Fixed broken burger menu by adding link to specific Font Awesome version in `footer.html`


- In footer
    - ~~add basic site information page~~
    - add disclaimer page

- Check
    - ~~sitemap~~
    - ~~RSS feed~~

- Blog posts
    - date
        Using date pulled from filename, removing `date` section from Front Matter, appears redundant

    - ~~tags~~ Done. This is helpful: https://hyrtsi.github.io/2024/01/01/tags-links-jekyll.html
    - search?
    - make sure front page is only pulling in last 3 blogs

Header
    - ~~create data file, remove `tags` link~~ Done.
