I'm Daniel Finnan, a doctoral candidate at the [Lirsa](https://lirsa.cnam.fr/) laboratory based at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers ([Cnam](https://cnam.fr/)) in Paris. My [thesis](https://theses.fr/s399291) is focused on Decentralized Finance (DeFi), under the supervision of [Dr. Iryna Veryzhenko](https://lirsa-en.cnam.fr/iryna-veryzhenko--1376272.kjsp#/) and [Dr. Elisa Darriet](https://lirsa-en.cnam.fr/elisa-darriet-1132788.kjsp). 

I'm particularly interested in Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), using blockchain data, data science, and time series econometrics to better understand market volatility and the impact of liquidity flows on novel trading venues during times of stress.

I hold a Master's in Economics, with a specialisation in Economic, Digital and Data Strategies from CNAM's department of Economics, Finance, Insurance and Banking ([Efab](https://efab.cnam.fr/)).

I code in Python, R, and occasionally in Rust and Javascript. <!-- I enjoy using and contributing to open source projects. -->
